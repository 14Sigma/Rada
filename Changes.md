# Kujua Release Notes

## 0.3.0-beta.37 

### Jan 21, 2014

- Fixes to user roles (@marc)
 
    Matches Transitional V2 in
    https://docs.google.com/a/medicmobile.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao9l2yegOFn7dEJRTEw1Z3RmZm0wTEo4Nk92NjVocnc

- Added support for Kemri Muvuku Form (KEMR)

- Added exclude_cols query param to csv/xml form exports. #421
    
    For example inlude `exclude_cols=1,5` in your query parameters to
    remove the first and fifth column of an export.

-  bugfix on export query params and UX adjustments

    Made English CSV export default. SpreadsheetML can be a little buggy
    because we're using HTML entities (not valid XML).
    
    Disabled default month value in exports screen since record count does
    not reflect the export row totals displayed.  It's probably better UX to
    have the user set the date knowing they are doing something than having a
    default that doesn't make sense with the totals on the screen and having
    to guess why that is.
    
- Added timezone support to exports #394

    Render page contents first and then load the fields data since that was
    holding up the page load.
    
    Indexing _id as `uuid` in field index so you can search for
    `uuid:10366976d62ab9a31257b2fad16113ee` now and it shows up in avaialble
    fields index.  For some reason I think underscore prefixed fields do
    show up in fields listing on Lucene for some reason.

- Fixed poor loading on search help #422


- added timezone support to exports #394
        
    Now dates in the exported spreadsheet should include your locale timezone. Controlled by the `tz` query param.
    
    
- Added new Messages Export and removed message data from Forms Export

    New http endpoint `/export/messages` to get messages export. Records are
    always latest first (reverse cronological).  Message export will include
    all records (valid and invalid), the point of the messages export is to
    give you access to all your message data, including outgoing error
    messages.
            
    **Warning**: the following URLs are no longer supported:
    
    ```
    /{form}/data_records.csv
    /{form}/data_records.xml
    /form_data_records.xml
    /form_data_records.csv
    ```
    
    Use `/export/forms/{form}` path instead.
    
    **Warning**: Existing form data export format has changed.  Included UUID of
    the related record so data among the two spreadsheets (messages and form
    data) can be correlated if need be.  Also removed the message
    data/columns from form data export. A record can be found via UUID by
    using `uuid:<the uuid string>` in the search box.
    
    Changed default column name of "From" to "Reported From".  Note if this
    shouldn't change if you have an existing install since it is generated
    based on your translation settings.

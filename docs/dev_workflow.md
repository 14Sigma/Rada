# Dev Workflow

## Branching

If you want to do code review, create a feature branch and then submit a pull request to the master branch (same repo) and have someone "ok" it for merge.

Typically if only 1 or 2 developers are working then you might have one 'dev' branch where new code is developed.  You can still do code review the same way as the case above.

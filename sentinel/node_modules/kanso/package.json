Your app and related code can be easily packaged and shared\nwith the community, or deployed to a number of cloud-hosted services.\n\nThe command-line tool is used for building and deploying these applications, as\nwell as providing some useful utilities for working with CouchDB and JSON data.\n\n\n## Why develop apps with Kanso?\n\n* __Scalability:__ easily grow from hobby-project to high-demand app with CouchDB\n* __Deployment:__ effortless to deploy, to the cloud or local machines, promoting\n  quick iterations\n* __Multi-platform:__ runs anywhere with CouchDB (Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and\n  iOS)\n* __Keep your data yours:__ now you can keep sensitive data in-house, and avoid\n  sharing it with cloud services\n* __Easy to distribute:__ apps are easy to share and distribute, between people and\n  servers\n* __Avoid lock-in:__ easy to deploy and based on open-source, don't be held hostage\n  to a proprietary API\n* __Homogeneity:__ your development environment matches your production environment\n* __One language to rule them all:__ with just CouchDB and the browser, all you\n  need to speak is JavaScript!\n\n\n## Get started\n\n    sudo npm install -g kanso\n\nLearn more: [Simplest possible app](http://kan.so/docs/Simplest_possible_app)\n\n\n## Developer community\n\nKanso is an open-source project written by developers using CouchApps everyday, in\nreal-world projects. Kanso provides the tools to share code and resources,\nregardless of the way in which your app is built. It's easy to use coffee-script,\nless stylesheets, or any number of JavaScript frameworks in your app, and still\nbenefit from the wealth of packages provided by the community.\n\nFind other Kanso developers in #kansojs on FreeNode, or on the mailing list.\n\n\n## Find out more\n\nFor more information on the project, check out the [Kanso website](http://kan.so).\n",
